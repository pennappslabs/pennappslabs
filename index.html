    <h3><a href="https://github.com/pennlabs/penn-sdk-python">Penn Registrar API</a></h3>
    <p>While Penn already had an API for its registrar, Labs worked with the administration to open up the API for developer use. With an easy to use python wrapper, the API allows developers to access up-to-date registrar information, including course schedules, registration status and locations.
